Williams 1985 SORCERER

3700 Sorcerer pinball machines were produced by Williams as pinball was struggling to survive in the mid-1980s. Sorcerer is one of only three titles that runs on the manufacturer’s System 9 electronics, and it is the rarest game of the bunch. The manufacturer touted the “Penetrating stare” and “Glare” of the Sorcerer’s eyes which glow and flash eerily in the rear of the playfield. He is said to “Hypnotize as he speaks”. When the player loses a ball they are “Chilled by an evil laugh”. The Sorcerer also offers his praise of “Well done mortal” when the player achieves certain goals in the game. Although Sorcerer was not a huge hit, it sold well enough to help keep pinball alive during a time when the popularity of arcade video games had dramatically reduced the demand for pinball machines. Machines like this one helped to “bridge the gap” and made it worthwhile for Williams to continue pinball production throughout the slow years, until the resurgence of interest in the game began in the early 1990s.
